## File Structure
Credit for the general structure of this project goes to Brendan M. Price (https://www.brendanmichaelprice.com/workflow/).

### Code
- `code/build` (data preparation)
- `code/check` (data validation)
- `code/learn` (exploratory analysis)
- `code/libraries` (external libraries used in code)
- `code/share` (public-facing analysis)

### Data
Included in .gitignore. Raw data is stored on the cloud elsewhere (ex: Dropbox, Onedrive) and copied into local directories as needed due to GitHub's file size restrictions. Derived data can be produced using the included code files.
- `data/raw` (data as it was acquired)
- `data/derived` (anything created in the project)

### Output
- `output/learn` (outputs of exploratory analysis)
- `output/share` (outputs of public-facing analysis)

### Paper
LaTeX files and pdfs.

### Renv
Generated by the `renv` package (https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html). Creates reproducible environments for R projects.

Important Commands:

- `renv::init()` was run once to generate necessary folders and files for this project. Likely don't need to run again unless something goes wrong.
- `renv::snapshot()` updates the lockfile with metadata about the currently-used packages in the project library. Run this after adding new packages.
- `renv::restore()` reproduces the current environment: uses the metadata from the lockfile to install exactly the same version of every package.
- `renv::install()` installs packages much like `install.packages()`, but can also install packages from GitHub, Bioconductor, and more.
- `renv::update()` gets the latest version of all dependencies.
